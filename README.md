==========

My personal dotcentral configuration

further description can be found in my blog post [Manage Your dotFiles Like a Boss](http://troydm.github.io/blog/2017/02/27/manage-your-dotfiles-like-a-boss/)

This repository now only contains configurations and actual dotfiles.
The central is now in separate Ruby gem [central](https://github.com/troydm/central)

To install central

    gem install central

Then clone configuration repository, cd into it and run central command
